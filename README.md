Simple analysis scripts for basic recursive tasks

- **apply_rescaling_trf_samples.py** apply correction factors recursively to all histograms belonging to a folder, for each file. Those corrections, e.g. TRF rescaling, are calculated based on another set of histograms with same name pattern but placed in a different folder

- **rebin_recursive.py** rebin all histograms from all files saved in a certain folder

- **check_refs_duplicates.py** check duplicates in biber output

- **scan_output_file.C** make a set of plots to show content of histograms from all files saved in a certain folder
